# You will likely prefer "language: generic" for travis configuration,
# rather than, say "language: python". Multibuild doesn't use
# Travis-provided Python but rather installs and uses its own, where the
# Python version is set from the MB_PYTHON_VERSION variable. You can still
# specify a language here if you need it for some unrelated logic and you
# can't use Multibuild-provided Python or other software present on a
# builder.
language: generic

# For CPython macOS builds only, the minimum supported macOS version and
# architectures of any C extensions in the wheel are set with the variable
# MB_PYTHON_OSX_VER: 10.9 (64-bit only) or 10.6 (64/32-bit dual arch). By
# default this is set to the highest available for the Python version selected
# using MB_PYTHON_VERSION. You should only need to set this explicitly if you
# are building a 10.6 dual-arch build for a CPython version where both a 10.9 and
# 10.6 build are available (for example, 2.7 or 3.7).
# All PyPy macOS builds are 64-bit only.
